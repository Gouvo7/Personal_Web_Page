        <p>
          I am located in Athens Greece and I am currently studying Informatics
          and Computer Engineering at the University of West Attica in Athens.
          Alongside with my studies, I currently work for
          <a href="https://www.datablue.gr/">DataBlue S.A</a> as a Junior
          Fullstack .NET Developer. In my role as a developer, I'm deeply
          involved in the maintenance of an API and the development of features
          for a desktop application used by doctors to help enhance job
          experience. I'm excited to be a part of a team that is making a
          significant impact on the healthcare industry by leveraging technology
          to improve healthcare management from a doctor's perspective.
          <br /><br />In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects and
          learning new technologies. I am passionate about software development
          and I am always looking for new opportunities to grow and expand my
          knowledge. But, whenever I don't feel like coding, I enjoy playing
          video games, watching movies and TV series, and spending time with my
          friends and family.

        <p>
          Throughout my journey as a developer, I have worked on a variety of
          projects that have helped me gain the experience and knowledge needed
          to become a successful developer. Some of the projects I have worked
          on include:
        </p>
        <div>
          <br><br>
          <h2>Vodafone Appointment Manager</h2>
          <br><br>
          <img class="projectImage" src="images/team_ready.png" alt="Image of the welcome screen of the vodafone appointment manager application."/>
          <div class="parbox">
            <p>
              Built using Java, this application was used in my time working for Vodafone Group as a salesman and tech specialist.
              The company was tracking down appointments on a daily basis and a monthly report was mandatory. The capabilities
              of this application are that users can arrange appointments with customers, edit appointment information and
              produce daily and monthly reports through the app.

          <h2>Shooting Range Management</h2>
          <br><br>
          <img class="projectImage" src="images/shooting_range.png" width="1000" height="auto" alt="Image of the starting screen of the shooting range application."/>
          <div class="parbox">
            <p>
              A while ago, there was a shooting range organization in Athens that contacted me and a friend of mine
              and they told us about the various problems that the have came across. Basically, none of the
              procedures (registration, various paperwork, warehouse count, training/match statistics etc.) were digitized,
              and the members of the organization had to fill in papers and send them to the local authorities.
              This application idea would resolve all of those problems by making all of the above procedures automated. The project
              was soon dropped as the organization could not support it further, but it was very helpful on extending my portfolio (C#).

          <h2>Exam Schedule Composition System (Thesis)</h2>
          <br><br>
          <img class="projectImage" src="images/thesis.png" width="auto" height="auto" alt="Image of my thesis, an exam schedule composition system."/>
          <div class="parbox">
            <p>
              Built using Java and other libraries, this application was built as my thesis project.
              The scope is that this app would be used for the purposes of each final exam schedule
              by my university, and later on, it would be adapted across various universities all over Greece.
              In a summary, the app uses .xlsx files as input and output at the same time, reading the excel files
              upon starting the application and saving the changes in a file. For portability and maintenance reasons,
              the catch is that we did not want to use any databases and for this reason, this is the reason that we chose
              to use .xlsx files for reading and storing data.
