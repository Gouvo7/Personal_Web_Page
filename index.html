        <h1>About Me</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="parbox">
        <p>
          I’m based in Athens, Greece, and I’m 24 years old. Currently, I’m pursuing a degree in 
          Informatics and Computer Engineering at the University of West Attica. Alongside my studies,
          I work at <a href="https://www.datablue.gr/">DataBlue S.A.</a> as a Junior Fullstack .NET Developer.
          In this role, I’m actively involved in maintaining an API and developing features for a desktop application
          designed to support doctors and enhance their day-to-day workflow. I’m proud to be part of a team that is
          making a meaningful impact on the healthcare industry by using technology to improve medical professionals'
          experiences.
          <br /><br /> In my free time, I enjoy building personal projects and exploring new technologies. I’m passionate 
          about software development and always eager to grow my skill set and take on new challenges. When I’m not coding, 
          I like to relax by playing video games, watching movies and TV series, or spending quality time with friends and family.

          Over the course of my development journey, I’ve worked on a variety of projects that have 
          helped me gain valuable experience and deepen my knowledge as a software developer. These projects
           have played a key role in shaping my skills and professional growth. Some of the highlights include:

              <h3>Shooting Range Data Management System</h3>
              <p>A while ago, a shooting range organization in Athens reached out to me and a colleague, sharing the 
                challenges they were facing. They explained that many of their processes—such as registration, paperwork, 
                inventory management, and training/match statistics—were still done manually. Members of the organization had to 
                complete paper forms and submit them to local authorities, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of automation.
                To address these issues, we came up with the idea for a desktop application that would automate these procedures 
                and streamline the entire workflow. Unfortunately, the project was eventually dropped as the organization was unable
                 to continue supporting it. However, this experience was invaluable in expanding my portfolio, particularly in C# development.</p>

              <h3>Vodafone Appointment Manager</h3>
              <p>This Java-based application was developed during my time at Vodafone Group, where I worked as a salesman and tech specialist.
                 The company required daily tracking of appointments and the generation of mandatory monthly reports. The application allowed 
                 users to schedule appointments with customers, as well as edit existing appointment details. Data was organized in folders—named
                  according to year and month—and stored in .txt files. At the end of each day or month, the system could generate .xlsx reports,
                   significantly reducing the time employees spent on manual documentation and improving overall efficiency.</p>

              <h3>Exam Schedule Composition System (Thesis)</h3>
              <p>This application was developed in Java, alongside supporting libraries, as part of my undergraduate thesis. 
                Its primary objective is to generate the final examination schedule for a university semester, with the long-term goal 
                of adapting it for broader use across academic institutions throughout Greece. The system relies exclusively on `.xlsx` 
                files for both input and output, reading structured data at startup and writing any changes back to Excel files. This design
                 choice—avoiding the use of traditional databases—ensures maximum portability and simplicity in maintenance, while still 
                 enabling robust data processing through well-defined spreadsheet formatting.</p>

              <h3>Hotel Management System</h3>
              <p>This was a final project developed during my time at university. The application was designed for hotel booking management, 
                catering to both hotel administrators and customers. Hotel staff could add rooms, manage bookings, and handle various operational 
                details, while customers could browse hotel information, view room images, and make reservations. The app featured two distinct 
                user interfaces, tailored to the type of user logged in. It utilized a database to store and manage all relevant information—from 
                reservations to room details. Built using C#, this project sparked my deeper interest in backend development and helped solidify my 
                understanding of fullstack application design. </p>

              <h3>Hardware Shop (e-Shop)</h3>
              <p>Developed as a final project for a university course, this was one of the most enjoyable projects I worked on at the time. Built using 
                HTML, CSS, PHP, and a database, the application is a fully functional e-shop where users can browse a wide range of computer hardware products, 
                view item details, and place orders. The platform was designed with user-friendliness and scalability in mind. Through the integrated database,
                 administrators could easily add, edit, or remove product listings. This project greatly enhanced my understanding of database management and 
                 highlighted the importance of delivering a smooth and intuitive user experience.

              <h3>Labyrinth Game VS Computer</h3>
              <p>Built using C++, this project was another final assignment developed during my time at university. It’s a simple yet engaging labyrinth
                 game where the player must locate a gem that spawns at random positions on the map and periodically changes location after a certain 
                 number of moves. The twist is that the player competes against a computer opponent, which uses a basic pathfinding algorithm to locate 
                 the gem. The goal is to reach the gem before the computer does. The game runs in the console, and the player navigates the labyrinth using
                  the arrow keys. The map is loaded from a .txt file provided as a command-line argument at launch. This was a fun and rewarding project 
                  that significantly deepened my understanding of object-oriented programming and game logic.</p>
