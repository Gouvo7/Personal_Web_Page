                  <h3>Shooting Range Data Management System</h3>
                  <p>
                    A while ago, a shooting range organization in Athens reached
                    out to me and a colleague, sharing the challenges they were
                    facing. They explained that many of their processes—such as
                    registration, paperwork, inventory management, and
                    training/match statistics—were still done manually. Members
                    of the organization had to complete paper forms and submit
                    them to local authorities, leading to inefficiencies and a
                    lack of automation. To address these issues, we came up with
                    the idea for a desktop application that would automate these
                    procedures and streamline the entire workflow.
                    Unfortunately, the project was eventually dropped as the
                    organization was unable to continue supporting it. However,
                    this experience was invaluable in expanding my portfolio,
                    particularly in C# development.

                  <p>
                    This Java-based application was developed during my time at
                    Vodafone Group, where I worked as a salesman and tech
                    specialist. The company required daily tracking of
                    appointments and the generation of mandatory monthly
                    reports. The application allowed users to schedule
                    appointments with customers, as well as edit existing
                    appointment details. Data was organized in folders—named
                    according to year and month—and stored in .txt files. At the
                    end of each day or month, the system could generate .xlsx
                    reports, significantly reducing the time employees spent on
                    manual documentation and improving overall efficiency.

                  <h3>Exam Schedule Composition System (Thesis)</h3>
                  <p>
                    This application was developed in Java, alongside supporting
                    libraries, as part of my undergraduate thesis. Its primary
                    objective is to generate the final examination schedule for
                    a university semester, with the long-term goal of adapting
                    it for broader use across academic institutions throughout
                    Greece. The system relies exclusively on `.xlsx` files for
                    both input and output, reading structured data at startup
                    and writing any changes back to Excel files. This
                    design—avoiding the use of traditional databases—ensures
                    maximum portability and simplicity in maintenance, while
                    still enabling robust data processing through well-defined
                    spreadsheet formatting.

                  <h3>Hotel Management System</h3>
                  <p>
                    This was a final project developed during my time at
                    university. The application was designed for hotel booking
                    management, catering to both hotel administrators and
                    customers. Hotel staff could add rooms, manage bookings, and
                    handle various operational details, while customers could
                    browse hotel information, view room images, and make
                    reservations. The app featured two distinct user interfaces,
                    tailored to the type of user logged in. It utilized a
                    database to store and manage all relevant information—from
                    reservations to room details. Built using C#, this project
                    sparked my deeper interest in backend development and
                    helped solidify my understanding of fullstack application
                    design.

                    Developed as a final project for a university course, this
                    was one of the most enjoyable projects I worked on at the
                    time. Built using HTML, CSS, PHP, and a database, the
                    application is a fully functional e-shop where users can
                    browse a wide range of computer hardware products, view item
                    details, and place orders. The platform was designed with
                    user-friendliness and scalability in mind. Through the
                    integrated database, administrators could easily add, edit,
                    or remove product listings. This project greatly enhanced my
                    understanding of database management and highlighted the

                  <h3>Labyrinth Game VS Computer</h3>
                  <p>
                    Built using C++, this project was another final assignment
                    developed during my time at university. It's a simple yet
                    engaging labyrinth game where the player must locate a gem
                    that spawns at random positions on the map and periodically
                    changes location after a certain number of moves. The twist
                    is that the player competes against a computer opponent,
                    which uses a basic pathfinding algorithm to locate the gem.
                    The goal is to reach the gem before the computer does. The
                    game runs in the console, and the player navigates the
                    labyrinth using the arrow keys. The map is loaded from a
                    .txt file provided as a command-line argument at launch.
                    This was a fun and rewarding project that significantly
                    deepened my understanding of object-oriented programming and
                    game logic.
