        <p>
          I am located in Athens Greece, I am 24 years old and I am currently studying Informatics
          and Computer Engineering at the University of West Attica in Athens.
          Alongside with my studies, I currently work for
          <a href="https://www.datablue.gr/">DataBlue S.A</a> as a Junior
          Fullstack .NET Developer. In my role as a developer, I'm deeply
          involved in the maintenance of an API and the development of features
          for a desktop application used by doctors to help enhance job
          experience. I'm excited to be a part of a team that is making a
          significant impact on the healthcare industry by leveraging technology
          to improve healthcare management from a doctor's perspective.
          <br /><br />In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects and
          learning new technologies. I am passionate about software development
          and I am always looking for new opportunities to grow and expand my
          knowledge. But, whenever I don't feel like coding, I enjoy playing
          video games, watching movies and TV series, and spending time with my
          friends and family.

          Throughout my journey as a developer, I have worked on a variety of
          projects that have helped me gain the experience and knowledge needed
          to become a successful developer. Some of the projects I have worked
          on include:

              <h3>Shooting Range Data Management System</h3>
              <p>A while ago, there was a shooting range organization in Athens that contacted me and a friend of mine
                and they told us about the various problems that the have came across. Basically, none of the
                procedures (registration, various paperwork, warehouse count, training/match statistics etc.) were digitized,
                and the members of the organization had to fill in papers and send them to the local authorities.
                This application idea would resolve all of those problems by making all of the above procedures automated. The project
                was soon dropped as the organization could not support it further, but it was very helpful on extending my portfolio (C#).</p>

              <h3>Vodafone Appointment Manager</h3>
              <p>Built using Java, this application was used in my time working for Vodafone Group as a salesman and tech specialist.
                The company was tracking down appointments on a daily basis and a monthly report was mandatory. The capabilities
                of this application are that users can arrange appointments with customers or edit appointment information. All of
                the data were stored inside folders (with certain names for each year and month) in .txt files. At the end of each day or each month, reports in .xlsx files could be
                produced to track down the required data, a prodecure which would save a lot of time for employees. </p>

              <h3>Exam Schedule Composition System (Thesis)</h3>
              <p>Built using Java and other libraries, this application was built as my thesis project.
                The scope is that this app would be used for the purposes of each final exam schedule
                by my university, and later on, it would be adapted across various universities all over Greece.
                In a summary, the app uses .xlsx files as input and output at the same time, reading the excel files
                upon starting the application and saving the changes in a file. For portability and maintenance reasons,
                the catch is that we did not want to use any databases and for this reason, this is the reason that we chose
                to use .xlsx files for reading and storing data.</p>

            <div class="carousel-caption d-none d-md-block">
              <h3>Hotel Management System</h3>
              <p>This was a final project for a course at my time in my University. This app was designed to be used by
                hotels to manage their bookings (add rooms, manage bookings etc) and for customers who wanted to book a hotel room and inspect
                various information about the hotel. The application has two different user interfaces based on the user type that logged in and used a database to store and manage all the 
              information, from bookings to displaying images per room. Build using C#, it was a very nice project that got me into deeping further for backend developing </p>

            <div class="carousel-caption d-none d-md-block">
              <h3>Hardware Shop (e-Shop)</h3>
              <p>Also built for a course's final examination for my University, this was one of the most fun projects I have built at that time.
                Build using HTML, CSS, PHP and a database, this app is a fully functional eshop where users could search through a variety of products
                related to computer hardware, view item details and make orders. The app was designed to be user-friendly, easy to use and scalable.
                Through the database, new item listings could be added, edited or deleted. Overall, this project helped me understand the importance of database management and user experience design.
